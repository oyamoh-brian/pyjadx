# PyJadx

PyJadx provides Python binding for [Jadx decompiler](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

As Jadx is written in Java, it use the JNI interface through [jni.hpp](https://github.com/mapbox/jni.hpp) to make the bridge Java / C++ then it uses [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
to create the bridge C++ / Python.
